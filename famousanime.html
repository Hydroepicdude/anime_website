      <p>
Sistine Fibel and her best friend Rumia Tingel attend the Alzano Imperial Magic Academy, one of the most prestigious magic schools in the Alzano Empire, and are eager to become top-rate magicians. But that won’t be easy as their new instructor is none other than the lazy, bumbling Glenn Radars. He'd rather sleep than teach, seems to have no magical abilities, and drives Sistine crazy with his lackadaisical attitude. But as dark forces converge on the school, will this proclaimed "bastard teacher" reveal his true clout as a magician?
